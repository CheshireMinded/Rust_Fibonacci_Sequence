# Rust_Fibonacci_Sequence
The purpose of this lab is to implement a program in Rust to extend the concepts of recursion, series, and irrational numbers discussed in class and the text.  Program should calculate: n!, demonstrate for the Fibonacci sequence that fn > (3/2)n-1 for any arbitrary n, and calculate an arbitrary number of digits of Ï€.
